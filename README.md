# Welcome Rocketman!

"A newcomer to Redberry always wonders where he found himself. What does Redbury's development mean? What kind of history does Redberry have.
And, at the same time, Redberry cares about what kind of developer you are, what your aspirations are.
To do this, we have developed the documentation and design of the application, and you, dear people, are responsible for inspiring the spirit of this application..."

...And I created this App!
